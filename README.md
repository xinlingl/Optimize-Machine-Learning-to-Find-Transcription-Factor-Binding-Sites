# ML-Method-For-TF-Motif

The goal of this project is to optimize machine learning methods to find transcription factor binding sites with high accuracy. In our project, we implemented CNN, RNN, and HMM and apply them to the same data set to see their performance.
<br />

Please read README.pdf to get an idea on how to run our program. 

710 project report.pdf contains the performance of each model and the results of comparions.
